# Sample Work

## Get Started
- Fork this repo.
- Start with desktop.png and build a website to match it(Pure HTML/CSS)
- Use the concepts you have learned to implement develop the site
- Avoid using external frameworks or library.
- The assets and images are given in the assets folder, so you don't have to spend time finding icons.
- Make sure to replicate the similar color and font-family and try to match as close the image(desktop.png)

## Expectaions
- Responsive design is not needed.
- Goal is to implement the concepts you learned, pixel perfect is not necessarily needed.
